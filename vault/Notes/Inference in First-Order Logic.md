- Inference involves drawing logical conclusions from a set of premises using the rules of deduction.
- First-Order Logic (FOL) extends propositional logic by introducing variables, quantifiers, and predicates.
- In FOL, inference aims to determine the truth or falsity of statements involving variables and quantified expressions.
- FOL inference uses rules such as modus ponens, universal instantiation, and existential generalization.
- It employs techniques like resolution and unification to derive new statements from existing ones.
- Inference in FOL allows for more expressive reasoning about objects, properties, and relations.
