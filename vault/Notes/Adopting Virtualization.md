# Adopting Virtualization
## Advantages of Virtualization

Here are some Pros/Benefits of Virtualization:

- Virtualization offers several benefits, such as it helps in cost reduction and boosting productivity towards the development process.
- It does away with the need to have a highly complex IT infrastructure.
- It facilitates remote access to resources and ensures that it promotes faster scalability.
- It is highly flexible, and it allows the users to execute multiple desktops operating systems on one standard machine.
- It removes the risks involved in terms of system failures, and it also boosts flexible data transfer between different virtual servers.
- The working process in Virtualization is highly streamlined and agile, which ensures that the users work and operate most economically.

## Disadvantages of Virtualization

The disadvantages of Virtualization are very much limited in nature. Here are the cons/disadvantages of Virtualization:

- The transition of the existing hardware setup to a virtualized setup requires an extensive time investment, and hence this can be regarded as a time-intensive process.
- There is a lack of availability of skilled resources that helps in terms of transition of existing or actual setup to virtual setup.
- Since there is a limitation in terms of having less skilled resources, the implementation of Virtualization calls for high-cost implementations.
- If the transition process is not handled meticulously, it also poses a security risk to sensitive data.
