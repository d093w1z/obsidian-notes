Organizing and storing information in AI.
- Goal: Enable machines to understand, manipulate, and utilize knowledge.
- Approaches: Symbolic, semantic networks, frames, ontologies, logic-based, probabilistic models.
- Symbolic: Rules, logical relationships.
- Semantic networks: Nodes (concepts), edges (relationships).
- Frames: Structured attributes and values.
- Ontologies: Formal representations, domain-specific concepts and relationships.
- Logic-based: Formal languages, logical statements and rules.
- Probabilistic models: Handling uncertainty with probabilities.
- Essential for: Reasoning, planning, problem-solving, language understanding.
- Depends on: Problem domain, available knowledge, reasoning capabilities.
- Facilitates: Knowledge sharing, learning, decision-making.
- Enables: Intelligent behavior, solving complex real-world problems.
