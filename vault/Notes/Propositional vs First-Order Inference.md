- Propositional inference deals with propositions that are true or false but lacks explicit representation of objects and relationships.
- First-Order Inference operates on first-order logic, which incorporates variables, quantifiers, and predicates for more expressive reasoning.
- Propositional inference focuses on truth-preserving operations like conjunction, disjunction, and implication.
- First-Order Inference goes beyond truth values to reason about objects, their properties, and relations.
- Propositional inference is simpler and computationally more tractable compared to first-order inference.
- First-Order Inference allows for more precise modeling and reasoning in domains with complex structures and relationships.
