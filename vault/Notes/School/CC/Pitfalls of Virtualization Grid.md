# Pitfalls of Virtualization Grid

## Advantages of virtualization

Virtualization is being pursued with great attention by numerous IT businesses. One of the main benefits of virtualization for platforms that support remote working is their integration with the cloud.

**1. Cheap**

IT infrastructures find virtualization to be a more affordable implementation option because it doesn't require the use or installation of actual hardware components. Dedicating substantial amounts of space and money to create an on-site resource is no longer required. We need a licence or access from a third-party vendor to begin using the hardware, just as if it were locally produced.

**2. Efficient**

By downloading the new versions of the software and hardware from a third-party supplier, efficient virtualization also enables automatic upgrades of both. By handling the problem themselves and saving money, IT specialists are able to avoid having to hire specialists. Virtualization also lessens the difficulty of managing resources to increase the effectiveness of virtual environments.

**3. Disaster recovery**

When servers are virtualized, disaster recovery is relatively simple thanks to fast backup restoration and current snapshots of your virtual machines. Organizations were better able to create a low-cost replication location thanks to virtualization. If a disaster occurs in the data centre or server room itself, you can still relocate such virtual machines to a cloud provider. Having the flexibility level guarantees that the disaster recovery plan will be simpler to implement and will have a 99% success rate.

**4. Deployment**

Resources may be deployed much more quickly when employing virtualization technology. It is feasible to significantly reduce the amount of time required for setting up physical devices or creating local networks. As a result, users really need is at least one connection to the virtual world. Additionally, the implementation of virtual machines is frequently simpler than the installation of actual models.

**5. Encourages digital entrepreneurship**

Prior to widespread virtualization, the average person found it nearly impossible to start a digital business. Thanks to the multiple networks, servers, and storage devices that are now accessible, almost anyone can start their own side business or turn into a business owner. Everyone can hang out their shingle and start looking for employment.

**6. Saves energy**

Both individuals and businesses can save energy by using virtualization. The rate of energy consumption can be reduced because no local hardware or software alternatives are being employed. To boost the total ROI of virtualization, monies can be used over time for other operational expenses rather than paying for a data centre's cooling costs and equipment operation costs.

**7. improved uptime**

Virtualization technologies have increased uptime dramatically. An uptime of 99.9999% is offered by some providers. Even low-cost carriers now offer uptime at a rate of 99.99%.

**8. Consistent cost**

People and corporations can have predictable expenses for their IT requirements because third-party vendors frequently offer choices for virtualization.

## Disadvantages of virtualization

Numerous complex dimensions that digital technology had to explore have been resolved through virtualization. However, virtualization still shows signs of minor but significant problems.Â **As a result, virtualization has a lot of drawbacks, which are listed below:**

**1. Exorbitant costs of implementation**

Virtualization would result in very low costs for the common person or business. In a virtualization environment, the suppliers, however, may incur very significant implementation expenses. It follows that devices must either be created, made, or purchased for implementation when hardware and software are eventually required.

**2. Restraints**

Virtualization is hampered by a number of issues. Virtualization cannot be used with every server and application currently in existence. Therefore, certain firms' IT infrastructures would not be able to support the virtualized solutions. They no longer receive support from a number of vendors as well. The demands of both individuals and organisations must be served using a hybrid approach.

**3. Problems with availability**

The accessibility of a company is another important factor. Long-term data linking is required. If not, the business would become less competitive in the market. Because every document from and for the client is essential to the service provider, availability difficulties might be seen as one of the drawbacks of virtualization. It seems as though the virtualization servers are taken offline. Additionally, hosted websites would be useless. The user has no control over this; it is completely the responsibility of the third-party providers.

**4. Time-intensive**

In comparison to local systems, virtualization takes less time to implement, but it ultimately costs users time. This is due to the fact that there are additional procedures that need to be completed in order to attain the desired result.

**5. Threats to security**

Information is our current currency. Having money allows you to make money. Without it, people will forget about you. The success of a corporation depends on information, hence it is frequently targeted.

**6. Problems with scalability**

People can grow a business or opportunity quickly owing to virtualization, but won't be able to grow it as large as they would like. In a virtualization network, growth generates latency since multiple firms share the same resources. There wouldn't be much that could be done to stop it, but one powerful presence could syphon money away from other, smaller businesses.

**7. A Number of links must interact**

If users have access to local equipment, they have complete control over their options. With virtualization, people lose control because numerous ties are required to cooperate in order to complete the same task. We can take the example of saving a document file. Using a local storage device like a flash drive or HDD, users can instantly save the content and even create a backup. In order to use virtualization, the ISP connection must be reliable.
