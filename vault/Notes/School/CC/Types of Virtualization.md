# Types of Virtualization

1. Hardware Virtualization.
2. Operating system Virtualization.
3. Server Virtualization.
4. Storage Virtualization.

## 1) Hardware Virtualization:

When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager _(VMM) is directly installed on the hardware system_ is known as hardware virtualization.

The main job of hypervisor is to control and monitoring the processor, memory and other hardware resources.

After virtualization of hardware system we can install different operating system on it and run different applications on those OS.

**Usage:**

Hardware virtualization is mainly done for the server platforms, because controlling virtual machines is much easier than controlling a physical server.

## 2) Operating System Virtualization:

When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager _(VMM) is installed on the Host operating system_ instead of directly on the hardware system is known as operating system virtualization.

**Usage:**

Operating System Virtualization is mainly used for testing the applications on different platforms of OS.

## 3) Server Virtualization:

When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager _(VMM) is directly installed on the Server system_ is known as server virtualization.

**Usage:**

Server virtualization is done because a single physical server can be divided into multiple servers on the demand basis and for balancing the load.

## 4) Storage Virtualization:

Storage virtualization is the _process of grouping the physical storage from multiple network storage devices so that it looks like a single storage device_.

Storage virtualization is also implemented by using software applications.

**Usage:**

Storage virtualization is mainly done for back-up and recovery purposes.
