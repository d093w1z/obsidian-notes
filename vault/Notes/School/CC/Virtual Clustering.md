# Virtual Clustering
In cloud computing, a virtual cluster is a group of virtual machines (VMs) that are deployed as a single logical unit. They share the same virtualization software and hardware, and they appear as a single unit to the end-user.

Virtual clusters provide the ability to scale operations easily. You can add or remove VMs to meet changing demands, and you can move VMs to optimize the use of hardware. You can leverage a virtual clustering solution to **reduce data center costs**, **increase efficiency**, and **increase scalability**.
