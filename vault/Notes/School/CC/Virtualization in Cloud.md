# Virtualization in Cloud
In Virtualization, a sensible or proper name is aligned with the physical server. The pointers are then directed towards that physical server, which is done on demand. Virtualization facilitates the execution of applications that are homogenous.

It also provides a virtual and isolated networking, storage, and memory area environment. The Virtualization is achieved through a host machine and guest machine. A host machine can be defined as the machine on which a virtual machine is developed, and the virtual machine so developed is termed as a guest machine.

Hardware virtualization plays a critical role by delivering infrastructure as a service solution most efficiently and effectively under a Cloud Computing process.

This type of Virtualization ensures portability. The guest machine is packaged as a virtual instance of an image, and such virtual images can be removed easily as and when the need arises.
