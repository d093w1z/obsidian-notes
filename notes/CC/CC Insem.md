## Q1.   Define Cloud Computing & Explain the importance of Cloud Computing?
### What is cloud
- Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.
- Cloud storage has grown increasingly popular among individuals who need larger storage space and for businesses seeking an efficient off-site data back-up solution.
- Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand.
- Services can be both public and private—public services are provided online for a fee while private services are hosted on a network to specific clients.
- Cloud security has become an increasingly important field in IT.
### Types of Cloud Services
Regardless of the kind of service, cloud computing services provide users with a series of functions including:

-   Email
-   Storage, backup, and data retrieval
-   Creating and testing apps
-   Analyzing data
-   Audio and video streaming
-   Delivering software on demand
  
### Importance:

### The Importance of Cloud Computing lies in the many Benefits that this process offers:

**1) Scalability:** Cloud computing allows you to use as many or as few resources as you need. Therefore, depending on your business needs or projected traffic to your business you can choose to increase or decrease your investment in IT infrastructure

**2) Saving Costs:** Cloud computing helps businesses to reduce costs in various ways. Companies only pay for the resources they use, making this process a more economical option than having to buy and manage their own resources. Cloud computing also results in considerable savings in Capital Expenditure and Operating Expenditure because companies do not have to invest in expensive hardware, storage devices, software, etc. 

**3) Disaster Recovery:** With all data stored in the ‘cloud’ backup and recovery of data and applications is quicker and more reliable. This applies to all sizes of organizations and volumes of data. 20% of cloud users claim disaster recovery in four hours or less as opposed to only 9% of non-cloud users. 

**4) Security:** It is the duty and responsibility of the cloud service providers to carefully monitor security. Compare this against an in-house I.T. department, for example, which is tasked with so many internal processes to manage; security is just one of the many items on the list. 

**5) Flexibility:** When using cloud computing the number of options is vast. Depending on the size of the organization, business needs, workloads, etc. companies can choose cloud infrastructure and services accordingly. 

### The Strategic Importance of Cloud Computing lies in the following:

**1) Accessibility and Increased Collaboration:** Cloud computing allows anyone, anywhere in the world, on any device to access the data stored. You only need an internet connection! What better way to get employees spread across geographical areas to collaborate on projects and assignments? 

**2) Automatic Updates:** Businesses do not have to go through the pain of manually updating and upgrading software and applications. The cloud service provider used usually maintains and updates software regularly.

**3) Increased focus on Core Business:** Given that cloud service providers take care of managing and updating cloud infrastructure, businesses can pay more attention to their business strengths; allowing them to grow and scale their businesses.

**4) Competitiveness:** Cloud computing is a transformational technology that has helped organizations across sectors deliver their products and services in a better way than before. Also, having to spend less time, effort, and money on I.T. resources allows businesses that use cloud computing to pay more attention to the business and respond better to changing market conditions; as opposed to those who haven’t yet understood the importance of cloud computing in business organizations.

## Q2.   Explain Cloud System Architecture with suitable diagram?
### Cloud Computing Architecture :  
The cloud architecture is divided into 2 parts i.e.

1.  Frontend
2.  Backend

![](Pasted%20image%2020230407174219.png)
![]()

Architecture of cloud computing is the combination of both [SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/service-oriented-architecture/) and EDA (Event Driven Architecture). Client infrastructure, application, service, runtime cloud, storage, infrastructure, management and security all these are the components of cloud computing architecture.

**1. Frontend :**  
Frontend of the cloud architecture refers to the client side of cloud computing system. Means it contains all the user interfaces and applications which are used by the client to access the cloud computing services/resources. For example, use of a web browser to access the cloud platform.

-   **Client Infrastructure –** Client Infrastructure is a part of the frontend component. It contains the applications and user interfaces which are required to access the cloud platform.
-   In other words, it provides a GUI( Graphical User Interface ) to interact with the cloud.

**2. Backend :**   
Backend refers to the cloud itself which is used by the service provider. It contains the resources as well as manages the resources and provides security mechanisms. Along with this, it includes huge storage, virtual applications, virtual machines, traffic control mechanisms, deployment models, etc.

1.  **Application –**  
    Application in backend refers to a software or platform to which client accesses. Means it provides the service in backend as per the client requirement.
2.  **Service –**  
    Service in backend refers to the major three types of cloud based services like [SaaS, PaaS and IaaS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cloud-based-services/). Also manages which type of service the user accesses.
3.   **Runtime Cloud-**  
    Runtime cloud in backend provides the execution and Runtime platform/environment to the Virtual machine.
4.  **Storage –**  
    Storage in backend provides flexible and scalable storage service and management of stored data.
5.  **Infrastructure –**  
    Cloud Infrastructure in backend refers to the hardware and software components of cloud like it includes servers, storage, network devices, virtualization software etc.
6.  **Management –**  
    Management in backend refers to management of backend components like application, service, runtime cloud, storage, infrastructure, and other security mechanisms etc.
7.  **Security –**  
    Security in backend refers to implementation of different security mechanisms in the backend for secure cloud resources, systems, files, and infrastructure to end-users.
8.  **Internet –**  
    Internet connection acts as the medium or a bridge between frontend and backend and establishes the interaction and communication between frontend and backend.
9.  **Database**– Database in backend refers to provide database for storing structured data, such as SQL and NOSQL databases. Example of Databses services include Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure SQL database and Google CLoud SQL.  
10.  **Networking**– Networking in backend services that provide networking infrastructure for application in the cloud, such as load balancing, DNS and virtual private networks. 
11.  **Analytics**– Analytics in backend service that provides analytics capabillities for data in the cloud, such as warehousing, bussness intellegence and machine learning.

## Q3.   Describe the Trends in Cloud Computing?

As more businesses rely on on-demand IT for anything from accounting software to full-fledged IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS solutions, the cloud continues to be a vital resource across multiple industries. Let’s have a look at five of the [cloud computing trends](https://www.veritis.com/blog/the-6-cloud-trends-which-shall-dominate-2022/) you can expect to witness in the future of cloud computing.

### 1) The Growth of Serverless Computing

Serverless computing is a cloud approach in which the customer doesn’t have to deal with infrastructure administration and server provisioning. Instead, the cloud service providers manage the supporting infrastructure and distribute computing power following the demand.

**Serverless computing provides many advantages to a business:**

-   You don’t pay a set price for a certain amount of bandwidth or storage. Instead, you can go with the pay-as-you-go model.
-   The internal team is not responsible for managing the servers.
-   The team can spend more time developing and developing new concepts because internal developers don’t have to provision complicated server clusters.
-   There is no risk of under- or over-provisioning because serverless platforms scale autonomously without any help from the internal staff.

Serverless computing is rapidly growing at a quick pace. Expect to see more businesses use serverless solutions in the upcoming year as it offers yet another way to improve team agility and save costs.

> “According to current predictions, between 2022 and 2026, demand for serverless technologies will increase by 22.6%.”

### 2) Even More Adoptions for AI and ML

All machine learning and [AI platforms](https://www.veritis.com/blog/how-ai-adoption-will-transform-your-business/) need a lot of processing power and data bandwidth, and the cloud is the most cost-effective approach to get these resources. AI and ML technologies complement each other.

-   AI guides **cloud IT services** in managing data while obtaining reliable insights into user behavior, trends, preferences, etc.
-   Cloud computing security increases the affordability and accessibility of AI.

Cloud computing plays a vital role in creating two emerging AI technologies.

**Creative Algorithms:**

These software tools use machine learning to produce everything from artificial data to works of art. These algorithms can also use to train different AI systems.

**Language Modeling:**

Programs that understand human languages more accurately are a technology that is expected to change how companies communicate with their customers.

Cloud computing for business will be crucial in delivering these services to customers and providing the necessary infrastructure for programs with high computational demands.

Not only big companies profit from AI’s usage of cloud network services. Cloud computing service models will become a popular entry point for high-end AI solutions among small and low-tech organizations. Start-ups and businesses with smaller resources could not use advanced ML and AI functionalities without the cloud.

Moreover, **cloud computing service** providers have allowed companies of all sizes and sorts to create AI/ML products. Since these AI/ML platforms demand a lot of processing power and bandwidth, [cloud migration optimization](https://www.veritis.com/infographics/aws-vs-azure-vs-gcp-breakdown-of-cloud-migration-services/) will unavoidably play a significant role in that expansion.

> “Consequently, experts predict that the AI market size will grow to USD 850.61 billion by 2028. “

### 3) Deploying to the Edge

Edge computing is a new method of processing data that doesn’t conduct activities inside a data center. Instead, processing and storing data occurs on specialized hardware at or close to the network’s edge.

**Every edge server has different storage capabilities, networking, and computing, allowing it to perform the following tasks:**

-   Security
-   Network switching and routing
-   Load balancing

In place of cloud computing, edge computing is not a viable alternative. Instead, edge and cloud computing solutions work best together, and this trend is already apparent in 2022.

**Using both cloud and edge technology allows IT environments to benefit from the cloud while also offering:**

-   Reduced bandwidth use
-   Data processing almost instantly
-   Low to no response time lag
-   Reduced data transmission rates

In 2022, edge computing will be crucial as more businesses attempt to boost efficiency by linking edge devices with cloud integration. At least 40% of organizations will look to incorporate Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) into their toolchains so that you can anticipate a rise in SASE as well. With the help of this security architecture, a business may monitor and regulate access to cloud applications and services, on-premises infrastructure, and end-user devices. SASE guides in upholding a high standard of security and compliance, two of the primary issues with edge computing.

### 4) Kubernetes and Blockchain

Kubernetes is a technology that offers a tamper-proof digital ledger that can record data without depending on a centralized authority. Blockchain technology is a game-changer but has scaling issues, particularly massive data management and storage.

A blockchain environment can scale quickly with the help of [Kubernetes (K8s)](https://www.veritis.com/services/kubernetes/), an open-source technology for automating deployments and scaling programs. With several containers running for a single essential service, K8s also offer high availability.

Enterprises will carry on pushing the boundaries of blockchain and K8s in 2022 since they work so well together.

### 5) More Focus on Cloud Security

The main barriers to cloud adoption continue to be issues about compliance, privacy, and integration problems. In response, **cloud service providers** are providing enhanced security features.

**In the feature, we will witness huge demand for:**

**Secure Access Service Edge (SASE):** SASE allows users to stably manage and regulate access across end-user devices, on-premise IT, and cloud apps.

**Cloud-Based Disaster Recovery (DR):** A business can use cloud disaster recovery to back up data and create a standby IT environment that can take over if the primary infrastructure fails.

A primary priority in 2022 will also be gaining visibility across many cloud application platforms. Additionally, business owners desire transparency across all IT environments to close gaps resulting in compliance infringements or cyberattacks.

## Q8.   Explain Seven-step model of migration into a Cloud?
Seven step migration model:
  
    1.  ASSESSMENT
Migration starts with an assessment of the issues relating to migration, at the application, code, design, and architecture levels. assessments are also required for tools being used, functionality, test cases, and configuration of the application. The proof of concepts for migration and the corresponding pricing details will help to assess these issues properly.

     2. ISOLATE
The second step is the isolation of all the environmental and systemic dependencies of the enterprise application within the captive data centre. These include library, application, and architectural dependencies. This step results in a better understanding of the complexity of the migration.

3. MAP
A mapping construct is generated to separate the components that should reside in the captive data centre from the ones that will go into the cloud. you should create a mapping of the current IT infrastructure and applications to the cloud. It helps you identify which cloud services and resources you need to use and how to integrate them with your existing systems.
4. RE-ARCHITECT
It is likely that a substantial part of the application has to be re-architected and implemented in the cloud. This can affect the functionalities of the application and some of these might be lost. It is possible to approximate lost functionality using cloud runtime support API.

5. AUGMENT
The features of cloud computing service are used to augment the application. This step involves adding new cloud services and resources to your existing infrastructure. You can use this step to enhance your systems and applications, add new features, and improve performance.

6. TEST
Once the augmentation is done, the application needs to be validated and tested. This is to be done using a test suite for the applications on the cloud. New test cases due to augmentation and proof-of-concepts are also tested at this stage.

7. OPTIMISE
The test results from the last step can be mixed and so require iteration and optimization. It may take several optimizing iterations for the migration to be successful. It is best to iterate through this seven step model as this will ensure the migration to be robust and comprehensive.
