-   Null Hypothesis:
    it represents the current state of affairs.
    claims two variables have no statistical significance
    intended to be rejected
    needs sufficient evidence to be rejected
    $$ H_0 : Null\ hypothesis$$$$H_0 : \mu_1 \ne \mu_2 $$
-   Alternate Hypothesis:
    inverse of null hypothesis
    claims 2 variables have statistical significance
    generally the statement to prove or test
    $$ H_1 : Alternate\ hypothesis$$$$H_1 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 $$
